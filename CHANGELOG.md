## [Unreleased]

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Initial release of `dev-perf`, a CLI tool that measures developer
  contributions to git repositories (any git URL or local path) over a
  date range and produces a JSON report of per-user metrics.
- Two-layered analysis per user: deterministic metrics counted straight
  from git history (commits, lines added/removed, files touched, churn,
  active days, per-language contribution sizes) merged with an LLM-based
  agentic layer that assesses what cannot be counted (work types,
  complexity, impact areas, quality signals).
- Fully in-process LLM analysis via the
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` library — no spawned server.
  Provider, model, and API key are always passed explicitly
  (`--model`, `--provider-url`, `--api-key` or the `DEV_PERF_*`
  environment variables); the user's global configuration is never
  read. Results are cached on disk and reused on reruns; `--refresh`
  forces a re-clone and invalidates the cache.
- Command-based CLI: the `report` command builds the JSON report, the
  `compile` command renders it into a markdown report with Vega-Lite
  SVG charts (team dynamics, per-repository and per-user charts, LLM
  summary pies, tables, appendix), and `version` prints the application
  version.
- Time-based period reports: `--unit day|week|month|quarter|year`
  splits the range into consecutive UTC-aligned periods, each with its
  own full per-repository report.
- Parallel analysis of multiple repositories with `--parallel <n>`, and
  automatic retry of failed LLM analyses with `--llm-retries <n>`.
- Environment-variable configuration: every `report` option has a
  `DEV_PERF_*` equivalent and every `compile` option a
  `DEV_PERF_COMPILE_*` one, and a `.env` file is auto-loaded at
  startup.
- A Docker image published to `ghcr.io/ameshkov/dev-perf` for both
  `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, sandboxing the analysis away from
  the host.
